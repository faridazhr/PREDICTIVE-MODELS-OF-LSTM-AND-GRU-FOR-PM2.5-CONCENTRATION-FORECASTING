# Predictive Models of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for PM2.5 Concentration Forecasting

Developed a Bachelor's thesis focusing on the comparative analysis of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models for PM2.5 concentration prediction. The research entailed exploring various model architectures, including vanilla, stacked, bi-directional, and stacked bi-directional, to forecast particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels.
